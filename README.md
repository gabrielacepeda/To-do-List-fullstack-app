**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express and MongoDB

This to do list utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express and MongoDB to allow the user to input list items and save them to the queue. The user has the ability to edit and delete items, clear completed items and clear the entire list. Completed items will have a line-through on click, and a message will display how many "To-Do's" are left to complete. Upon refreshing the page, the list items remain unless deleted.

## Optimizations

This app works, but when the user attempts to edit an item, sometimes the text will not appear in the input, but instead on the edit button itself.

## Lessons Learned:

Relying on back-end frameworks such as Node.js, Express and MongoDB to make an app functional was new to me.

## Installation

1. Clone repo
