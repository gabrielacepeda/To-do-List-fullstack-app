**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express and MongoDB

This to do list utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express and MongoDB to allow the user to input list items and save them to the queue. I was able to create a simple to-do list app. Enter text into the input and it will appear in the list. Upon refreshing the page, the list items remain unless deleted.

## Optimizations

I am still working out some kinks in this app. I'm currently working on the edit feature, as it won't give you the option of editing an item.

## Lessons Learned:

Relying on back-end frameworks such as Node.js, Express and MongoDB to make an app functional was new to me.
